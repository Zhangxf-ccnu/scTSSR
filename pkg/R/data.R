#' Human pancreatic islet data

#'

#' This is the Human pancreatic islet dataset (GSM2230757). The raw data contains 20,125 genes and 1,937

#' cells. Here we use the reference and downsampled datasets generated by Huang et al (2018) which contain

#' 2,284 genes and 1,076 cells (available at https://github.com/mohuangx/SAVER-paper/tree/master/SAVER-data).

#' For details about the approach to generate the reference and downsampled

#' datasets, please refer to Huang et al (2018). This data is an object of class list of length two. count.ref is the

#' reference count matrix and count.samp is the downsampled count matrix.
